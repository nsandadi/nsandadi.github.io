## Airlines Departure Delay Prediction

**Project description:** Predicting delays helps airports and airlines plan their resources and let passengers plan their travel accurately. If we predict a delay when there is none, airports end up allocating unnecessary resources and airlines end up with dissatisfied customers who missed their flights. If we predict no delays when there is one, it can potentially result in last minute gate changes and other emergency planning for the airlines and airports.

The core questions : 
- Given all the information available prior to a flight can we accurately predict the delay? 
- Additionally, can we identify the likely causes of the delay?

To answer the first question we have to define what constitutes a “delay”. In our problem we defined that a flight is “delayed” if the delay is 30 minutes or more. And to answer the second part of the question, we resorted to our model implementation to give us some useful feedback.
